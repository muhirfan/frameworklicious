# CloudKit Framework Overview

CloudKit is built into **iOS**, **macOS**, **iPadOS**, **watchOS**, and **tvOS**, providing a seamless way for your app to store structured data in iCloud containers. It offers three database types:

- **Private Database**: Unique per user.
- **Public Database**: Shared by all users.
- **Shared Database**: Collaborative record zones.

With CloudKit, you work with **records** and **fields** (similar to rows and columns in a database), and Apple's servers automatically handle **network communication**, **data encryption**, and **device syncing**.

## What is CloudKit?

CloudKit powers iCloud integration for developers, giving your app direct access to Apple’s cloud servers **without needing a custom backend**. 

### Key Features:

- Import the `CloudKit` module to **fetch**, **save**, **update**, or **delete** records.
- Define record types and schemas using **CloudKit Dashboard**.
- Query records with **NSPredicate**–based queries.
- System handles syncing, conflict resolution, and data security.

#  App Intents Overview

**App Intents** is Apple‚Äôs unified framework for exposing your app‚Äôs features system-wide‚Äîvia Siri, Shortcuts, Spotlight, Widgets, the Action button, and more.  
Instead of writing separate integrations (like SiriKit, widget APIs, Spotlight indexing), you declare **Intents** (actions) with **Parameters** (user inputs) once, and the OS handles discovery, input collection, and deep-linking automatically.

**Benefits:**
- Increased app discoverability
- Higher user engagement
- Enables non-technical users to automate workflows‚Äîno coding required

## How App Intents Actually Work (Non-Technical)

Think of **App Intents** like giving your app superpowers ‚Äî so it can talk to Siri, show up in Spotlight search, or work with the Shortcuts app.

Here‚Äôs a real-world comparison to help you understand:

> Imagine your app is a restaurant.  
> App Intents are like putting items from your menu into a **universal food delivery app** (like DoorDash).  
> Now, customers (users) can:
> - Search for your dish (in Spotlight or Siri)
> - Ask Siri to "Order sushi from [Your App]"
> - Add it to a routine, like "When I get home, order dinner."

All you do as a developer is:
- üìã Describe what your app can do (Intents)
- üßë‚Äçüç≥ Explain what options the user can pick (Parameters)
- üß≠ Let Apple handle the rest (UI, voice, automation)

### So what happens when someone uses your shortcut?
1. The system finds your Intent (like "Change background color").
2. It asks the user for any needed info ("What color?").
3. It runs the logic you wrote.
4. (Optional) It can open your app to show the result.

This means **anyone**, even non-coders, can automate your app ‚Äî just by using natural language or tapping a Shortcut!

##  How It Works

### 1. Define an Intent
Create a Swift struct that conforms to `AppIntent`, add a title, optional description, and implement the `perform()` method.

### 2. Declare Parameters
Use the `@Parameter` property wrapper to collect inputs like strings, dates, enums, or custom types.

### 3. Publish Shortcuts
Conform to `AppShortcutsProvider`, then define entries inside `@AppShortcutsBuilder` with:
- Example phrases
- `shortTitle`
- SF Symbol name

### 4. (Optional) Open App
Use:
```swift
static var openAppWhenRun: Bool = true
```

##  Low-Level Syntax

### Declaring an Intent

```swift
import AppIntents

@available(iOS 16.0, *)
struct MyActionIntent: AppIntent {
  static var title: LocalizedStringResource = "My Action"
  static var openAppWhenRun: Bool = true

  @Parameter(title: "Name")
  var name: String

  static var parameterSummary: some ParameterSummary {
    Summary("Do My Action with \(.$name)")
  }

  func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
    // your business logic here‚Ä¶
    return .result()
  }
}
```


## Providing Shortcuts

```
import AppIntents

@available(iOS 16.0, *)
struct IntentProvider: AppShortcutsProvider {
  @AppShortcutsBuilder
  static var appShortcuts: [AppShortcut] {
    AppShortcut(
      intent: MyActionIntent(),
      phrases: [
        "Run My Action with name {Name}"
      ],
      shortTitle: "Do My Action",
      systemImageName: "bolt.fill"
    )
  }
}
```
 This makes My Action immediately discoverable in the Shortcuts app and Spotlight ‚Äî no further setup required.

##  Examples

### 1. Change Color

- **Intent:** `ChangeColorIntent`
- **Parameter:** `ColorChoice` (AppEnum: red/green/blue)
- **openAppWhenRun:** `true`
- **Shortcut:** `"Change background color to green"`

 Common in App Intents tutorials.

---

### 2. Add a Timestamped Item

- **Intent:** `AddItemIntent(timestamp: Date)`
- **Dependency:** `@Dependency(key: "ModelContainer")`
- **Result:** Silent insertion into SwiftData container

Great for logging events or hands-free data capture.

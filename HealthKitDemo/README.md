# HealthKit – Unified Health & Fitness Framework by Apple

Apple’s HealthKit is a unified framework that centralizes health and fitness data on iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS devices. It enables apps to read and write to a shared Health Store with the user’s explicit permission.

> HealthKit is a secure, on-device repository protected by encryption and fine-grained consent controls. It supports standard health data types such as steps, heart rate, active energy, distance, and sleep.

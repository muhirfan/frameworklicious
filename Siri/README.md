# AppIntents Framework Overview

The **App Intents** framework enables your app to expose custom actions that users can trigger using **Siri**, **Spotlight**, or the **Shortcuts app**. It revolves around two main building blocks:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `AppIntent` protocol | Conform a type to this protocol to define an action your app can perform. Specify inputs (parameters), a title/description, and sample phrases to help Siri understand user intent. |
| `AppShortcutsProvider` protocol | Implement this to organize and group intents into discoverable app shortcuts. Xcode bundles these at build time for immediate availability after app installation. |

## How App Intents Work

When a user invokes an app shortcut via voice or tap, the system:

1. Matches the user's speech or tap against your sample phrases.
2. Resolves parameters like text, dates, or custom types.
3. Launches your app in the background and calls the `perform()` method.
4. Returns an `AppIntentResponse`, optionally with:
   - Spoken feedback via Siri.
   - A SwiftUI view displayed inline within Siri’s UI.

## What Are App Intents?

An **App Intent** is a self-contained task (e.g., “Start a workout”, “Translate text”) that your app can handle on demand. Each intent includes:

- **Parameters**: Inputs required to run the task (dates, strings, enums, custom data).
- **Metadata**: Title, description, and keywords to help Siri surface the intent.
- **Example Phrases**: Natural-language phrases users might say to trigger the intent.

Once triggered, the `perform()` method executes your app logic (e.g., data fetch, device control) and returns a response. The result can include audio dialog and inline UI, offering rich interaction without opening the app.

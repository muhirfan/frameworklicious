# ARKit – Augmented Reality Framework by Apple

ARKit is Apple’s high-level augmented reality framework that combines device motion tracking, camera scene capture, and advanced scene processing to seamlessly blend virtual content with the real world.

> Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines also include a dedicated section on AR to help you design immersive, intuitive experiences that respect user context and device capabilities.

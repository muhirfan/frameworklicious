# Core Motion – Sensor Framework by Apple

A simple SwiftUI app showcasing Apple’s Core Motion framework, enabling real-time access to motion sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, and pedometer. Live charts and unit annotations demonstrate how to collect, process, and visualize motion data on iOS devices.

## About Core Motion

Core Motion is Apple’s high-level API for accessing motion and environmental data from built-in device sensors. It provides:

- **Raw Sensor Data**: Accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
- **Fused Device Motion**: Attitude, gravity, and user acceleration
- **Fitness & Activity Data**: Step counting, floor counting, altitude, and pressure
